This Project shows the implementation of the Bloom Filter Algorithm, which is really usefull for research algorithms.
Inside this repository you can find the sequential and the parallel version of this algorithm, both in C++.
The Parallel Version has been created using OpenMP.
You can use the programs for every kind of data you want to analyse.
